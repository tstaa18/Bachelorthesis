# Bachelorthesis
Hi. This is my code for my bachelorthesis in "Interactive soft breathing robot that responds to human face detection".
There is two different parts, one for face detection and facial expression analysis(Python) and one for crontrolling the breathing patterns of the soft robot(Arduino)
